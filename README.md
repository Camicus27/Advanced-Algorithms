# CS4150 Advanced Algorithms at the University of Utah
This is a collection of algorithmic code I wrote to solve various scenarios using advanced Computer Science topics such as Dynamic Programming, Memoization, and Graph theory (DFS, BFS, WFS, Dijkstra's Algorithm, etc.).

# MinCut-MaxFlow
Minimum spanning tree using Dijkstra's graph algorithm to find the maximum flow through a graph.

# Maze Monster
Using a WFS to place monsters in a grid-like maze then efficiently searching the maze that avoids hitting a monster while finding treasure.

# Pier to Pier
Using backtracking and pruning to efficiently find all possible connections of nodes with some given restraints.

# Shortest Path
Like the name suggests, this creates a map of roads and intersections, then given a source and destination, navigates the shortest path from A to B.

# Friend Questing
Given players with a certain list of quests, either to be completed alone or as a group, perform a topographical sort to find the most efficient order to complete the quests.
